# RavenUtils
Raven Utils is a modular collection of mods that make Minecraft more realitic, sometimes more convinient and sometimes more challenging. Here is a short description of what every module offers. If you like to have a lightweight modpack you may want to use Essentials only. If you prefer to have all bonus contents, tweaks and additions you may want to add more modules to your pack.
